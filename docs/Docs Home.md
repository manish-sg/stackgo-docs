SaaS platforms are more ubiquitous than ever. Theyâ€™re growing in popularity in an increasingly congested and finely stratified SaaS market. Product integrations into SaaS platforms can be a channel for growth, improving customer retention, creating seamless customer journeys and a hotbed for innovation on your core offering. We have written a lot about the importance of SaaS integrations on our blog, [feel free to check out this post](https://stackgo.io/software-marketplaces-for-growth/).


Goal in both cases is to reduce developer effort, but in the case of customer product integrations the goal is to make a many:many integration that makes the end customers life much easier.

- Product Composition integrations - Usually 1:many
  - Payment processing
  - Application Monitoring application
  - Authentication provider

- Customer Product integration

StackGo realises that devlopment time is a critically limiting factor in how many product integrations get undertaken. Therefore we are deeply commited to our vision of an ecosystem of developer tools that boost effiancy by a factor of 10 by reducing boilerplate dependencies allowing for faster iterations and greater agilty.

We have also written extensivley about how to find your ideal use-case for building product integrations for product and technology leaders. Please see [this blog for more details](https://stackgo.io/data-integration-and-saas-marketplaces/)

From a technical implementation point of view there are a few concepts to introduce to make the most of the StackGo platform.
