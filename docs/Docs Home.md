# StackGo Philosophy


SaaS platforms are more ubiquitous than ever. Theyâ€™re growing in popularity in an increasingly congested and finely stratified SaaS market. Product integrations into SaaS platforms can be a channel for growth, improving customer retention, creating seamless customer journeys and a hotbed for innovation on your core offering. We have written a lot about the importance of SaaS integrations on our blog, [feel free to check out this post](https://stackgo.io/software-marketplaces-for-growth/).

At StackGo we realise that devlopment time is a limiting factor in how many product integrations get built. Since each platform has its own data model, oAuth implementation and mode of operations. Therefore we are deeply commited to our vision of an ecosystem of developer tools that boost effiancy by a factor of 10 by reducing to allow for faster iterations and greater agilty. 

We have also written extensivley about how to find your ideal use-case for building product integrations for product and technology leaders. Please see [this blog for more details](https://stackgo.io/data-integration-and-saas-marketplaces/) 


### StackGo Suite

#### Managed Authentication 

All SaaS product integrations require authorization and authentication before any data can be transacted, this is where managed authentication comes in! 
StackGo offers its managed authentication to allow developers to get started quickly with oAuth based platforms with a standardised approache that is state of the art and secure implementation. Hence developers can focus on building features for customers rather than being bogged in the minutiae of authentication. It also reduces the cost of experimentation and starting integrations with new platforms.

From a technical implementation point of view there are a few concepts to introduce to make the most of the StackGo platform.

For StackGo to provide with the best developer experiance our product suite starts off with a managed authentication process for building oAuth based app experiances. 

When you login to the StackGo platform you will see prompts asking you to select which platform would you like to create a connection. The first step for that would be

App Credentials Identifier `appSlug`
